# Mixed Reality Design Labs
This repo is where Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality Design team publishes sample apps and experiments.

# Surfaces
Surfaces is an open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs. It demonstrates how to use **[Mixed Reality Toolkit(MRTK)](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)**'s input system and building blocks to create an app experience for HoloLens 2. In this project, you can find the examples of:
- Use MRTK's **[Input System](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/Input/Overview.html)**, specifically hand / joint tracking.
- Use MRTK's **[Standard Shader](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_MRTKStandardShader.html)** for performant graphics.

You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experiences.
